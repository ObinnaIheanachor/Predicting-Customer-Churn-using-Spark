## Project Overview
In this project using Apache Spark on IBM Cloud, I analysed data for a fictitious music streaming platform; **Sparkify** in order to build a machine learning model that helps predict customer churn.

## Project Requirements
You can run the notebook locally but you will have to install **pyspark** and all it's dependencies in your project environment.

For Windows users you can check out this [blogpost](https://changhsinlee.com/install-pyspark-windows-jupyter/) on how to run pyspark locally.

The dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/hendrik-sill/DSND-Sparkify-Capstone-Project/blob/master/mini_sparkify_event_data.json)

To run this on **IBM Cloud**:
* Visit [cloud.ibm.com](cloud.ibm.com) and click on the "Create an IBM account" button. If you have an IBM Cloud account already, sign in.
* Register for IBM Watson Studio.
* Next, select "**Create Project**."
* Enter a name for your project and click "Create" on the bottom right.
* Click "**Add to project**" on the top and select "**Notebook**"
* You can download then import this notebook to your project or create a new one and choose  "**Default Spark Python 3.6 XS**" under runtime
